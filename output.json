In order to win this competition, you need to come up with an excellent and creative plan for a solution and then implement this solution in Python. We will now provide a description of the task.\n\n# Task description\n\n## Task goal\n\nPredict the sales price for each house\n\n## Task evaluation\n\nUse the RMSE metric between the logarithm of the predicted and observed values.\n\n# Memory\n\n\n\n# Instructions\n\n## Response format\n\nYour response should be a brief outline/sketch of your proposed solution in natural language (3-5 sentences), followed by a single markdown code block (wrapped in ```) which implements this solution and prints out the evaluation metric. There should be no additional headings or text in your response. Just natural language text followed by a newline and then the markdown code block.\n\n## Solution sketch guideline\n\n- This first solution design should be relatively simple, without ensembling or hyper-parameter optimization.\n- Take the Memory section into consideration when proposing the design, don't propose the same modelling solution but keep the evaluation the same.\n- The solution sketch should be 3-5 sentences.\n- Propose an evaluation metric that is reasonable for this task.\n- Don't suggest to do EDA.\n- The data is already prepared and available in the `./input` directory. There is no need to unzip any files.\n\n\n## Implementation guideline\n\n- <TOTAL_TIME_REMAINING: 23.0hrs 59.0mins 59.87117862701416secs>\n- <TOTAL_STEPS_REMAINING: 20>\n- The code should **implement the proposed solution**, **print the value of the evaluation metric computed on a hold-out validation set**,\n- **AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SAVE PREDICTIONS ON THE PROVIDED UNLABELED TEST DATA IN A `submission.csv` FILE IN THE ./submission/ DIRECTORY.**\n- The code should be a single-file python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is.\n- No parts of the code should be skipped, don't terminate the before finishing the script.\n- Your response should only contain a single code block.\n- Be aware of the running time of the code, it should complete within an hour.\n- All the provided input data is stored in \"./input\" directory.\n- **You MUST submit predictions on the provided unlabeled test data in a `submission.csv` file** file in the \"./working\" directory as described in the task description** This is extremely important since this file is used for grading/evaluation. DO NOT FORGET THE submission.csv file!\n- You can also use the \"./working\" directory to store any temporary files that your code needs to create.\n- REMEMBER THE ./submission/submission.csv FILE!!!!! The correct directory is important too.\n\n\n## Installed Packages\n\nYour solution can use any relevant machine learning packages such as: `timm`, `pandas`, `torch-geometric`, `lightGBM`, `torchvision`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `bayesian-optimization`, `numpy`, `statsmodels`, `xgboost`. Feel free to use any other packages too (all packages are already installed!). For neural networks we suggest using PyTorch rather than TensorFlow.\n\n# Data Overview\n\n```\ninput/\n    data_description.txt (523 lines)\n    sample_submission.csv (1460 lines)\n    test.csv (1460 lines)\n    train.csv (1461 lines)\nsubmission/\n\nworking/\n```\n\n-> input/sample_submission.csv has 1459 rows and 2 columns.\nThe columns are: Id, SalePrice\n\n-> input/test.csv has 1459 rows and 80 columns.\nThe columns are: Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2... and 65 more columns\n\n-> input/train.csv has 1460 rows and 81 columns.\nThe columns are: Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2... and 66 more columns\n"
