In order to win this competition, you need to come up with an excellent and creative plan for a solution and then implement this solution in Python. We will now provide a description of the task.\n\n# Task description\n\n## Task goal\n\nPredict the author of a sentence as one of Poe, Lovecraft, or Shelley\n\n## Task evaluation\n\nUse multi-class logarithmic loss between predicted author probabilities and the true label.\n\n# Memory\n\n\n\n# Instructions\n\n## Response format\n\nYour response should be a brief outline/sketch of your proposed solution in natural language (3-5 sentences), followed by a single markdown code block (wrapped in ```) which implements this solution and prints out the evaluation metric. There should be no additional headings or text in your response. Just natural language text followed by a newline and then the markdown code block.\n\n## Solution sketch guideline\n\n- This first solution design should be relatively simple, without ensembling or hyper-parameter optimization.\n- Take the Memory section into consideration when proposing the design, don't propose the same modelling solution but keep the evaluation the same.\n- The solution sketch should be 3-5 sentences.\n- Propose an evaluation metric that is reasonable for this task.\n- Don't suggest to do EDA.\n- The data is already prepared and available in the `./input` directory. There is no need to unzip any files.\n\n\n## Implementation Guideline\n\n- 1. Write a complete, single-file Python script.\n- 2. starting with imports, and load necessary data from the './input/' directory.\n- 3. Implement the simple solution proposed in your plan.\n- 4. Calculate the evaluation metric on a validation set and **print it clearly** using a recognizable format, e.g., `print(f'Validation Metric: {metric_value}')`.\n- 5. **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Generate predictions for the test data and save them EXACTLY to the path `./submission/submission.csv`. Ensure the file format matches the task description.\n- 6. The script must run without errors. Focus on correctness first.\n\n\n## Installed Packages\n\nYour solution can use any relevant machine learning packages such as: `xgboost`, `torch-geometric`, `numpy`, `lightGBM`, `scikit-learn`, `torchvision`, `timm`, `bayesian-optimization`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `torch`. Feel free to use any other packages too (all packages are already installed!). For neural networks we suggest using PyTorch rather than TensorFlow.\n\n# Data Overview\n\n```\ninput/\n    description.md (98 lines)\n    sample_submission.csv (8393 lines)\n    test.csv (8393 lines)\n    train.csv (19580 lines)\nsubmission/\n\nworking/\n```\n\n-> input/sample_submission.csv has 8392 rows and 4 columns.\nHere is some information about the columns:\nEAP (float64) has 1 unique values: [0.403493538995863]\nHPL (float64) has 1 unique values: [0.287808366106543]\nMWS (float64) has 1 unique values: [0.308698094897594]\nid (object) has 8392 unique values.
