The code also references other undefined functions (`decimal_to_words`, `fraction_to_words`) in NUMBER_PATTERNS\n3. The pattern matching system is incomplete - while patterns are defined, the actual conversion functions are missing\n4. The validation shows this is a hybrid approach using both pattern matching and lookup tables, but the pattern matching part is incomplete\n\n## Fix Plan:\n1. Remove the incomplete pattern matching system since it's causing errors and we can rely on the lookup tables which are working\n2. Simplify the normalization to use only the lookup tables from the training data\n3. Keep the validation split to measure accuracy\n4. For tokens not found in the lookup tables, default to returning the original token\n5. Generate the submission file in the required format\n\nHere's the corrected implementation:",
