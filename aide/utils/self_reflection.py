Use the task details from the competition description (self.task_desc) to guide your review. In your response, first provide a brief explanation (3–5 sentences) of the identified issues and the modifications you made, and then output a single markdown code block that is an exact copy of the original code with only the minimal modifications necessary to fix these bugs.

In this round, concentrate on ensuring that variable usage, data transformations, and all method imports adhere to the requirements stated in the competition description (self.task_desc).
