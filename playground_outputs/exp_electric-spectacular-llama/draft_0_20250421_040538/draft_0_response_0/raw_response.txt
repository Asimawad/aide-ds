Okay, so I need to solve this Kaggle competition problem where I have to predict the author of a sentence as one of three: Poe, Lovecraft, or Shelley. The task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the author of a given text. 

First, I should understand the problem thoroughly. The goal is to predict the author based on the text content. The data provided includes three columns: EAP, HPL, and MWS, which are float values representing different metrics. These metrics likely correspond to the author's style or characteristics. The task is to use this data to predict the author.

I need to plan the approach. Since the task is classification with three possible outcomes, I should consider using a classification model. Multi-class classification is suitable here because there are three distinct classes: Poe, Lovecraft, and Shelley. 

I should start by understanding the data better. The input includes three CSV files: train, test, and sample_submission. The text data is in the 'text' column, and the metrics are in 'EAP', 'HPL', and 'MWS'. The task is to predict the author, so the model needs to learn from the text and the metrics to classify the author correctly.

I should think about the features. The text is a key feature here, as it contains the content that can help distinguish between the authors. The metrics might be redundant or could be derived from the text, but they are provided for the purpose of the task. I need to decide whether to use the metrics or not. Since the metrics are given, I'll include them as features in the model.

Next, I should consider the evaluation metric. The problem statement mentions multi-class logarithmic loss, which is suitable for classification tasks with multiple classes. It measures the performance of a classification model where the predicted probability represents the confidence of the model's prediction. So, I'll use multi-class logarithmic loss as the metric to evaluate the model.

For the model, I can use a Random Forest classifier because it's a non-parametric model that can handle both classification and regression tasks. It's also robust and can handle a large number of features, which is beneficial here. Alternatively, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) could be considered, but Random Forest might be more suitable for text data since it can handle high-dimensional data well.

I should also think about feature engineering. The text data might have some features that can be extracted, like word frequencies, n-grams, or TF-IDF features. However, since the text is in a single column, I might need to process it differently. Maybe extract features from the text to improve the model's performance.

Another consideration is the data preprocessing. The text data might need tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to improve feature extraction. Also, handling imbalanced classes is important because the data might be imbalanced, and the model might perform better on one class than the others.

I should also think about the model's performance. Since the metrics are float values, they might not be directly correlated with the author. So, the model might need to learn from the text content effectively. I can use techniques like TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features, which can then be used in the model.

In terms of implementation, I'll need to load the data, preprocess it, split it into training and validation sets, train the model, and evaluate it using the specified metric. I'll also need to ensure that the predictions are saved correctly to the submission file.

I should outline the steps clearly: data loading, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and saving predictions. I'll make sure to include the necessary imports, like pandas for data loading, sklearn for models, and metrics. I'll also need to handle the data splitting and evaluation properly to get accurate results.

I should also think about potential issues. For example, if the metrics are not informative, the model might not perform well. So, I should check the metrics and see if they can provide useful information for the model. If not, I might need to find another feature or consider a different approach.

In summary, the plan is to use a Random Forest classifier with text features extracted from the text data, using TF-IDF, and evaluate it using multi-class logarithmic loss. The model will be trained on the training data, and predictions will be saved to the submission file.

1) PLAN:
- Use a Random Forest classifier for multi-class classification.
- Extract text features using TF-IDF from the text data.
- Use multi-class logarithmic loss as the evaluation metric.
- Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Implement feature engineering to improve model performance.
- Train the model and evaluate it using the specified metric.
- Save predictions to the submission file.

2) CODE:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import multiclassification_loss
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
train = pd.read_csv('input/train.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('input/test.csv')
sample_submission = pd.read_csv('input/sample_submission.csv')

# Prepare features
text_features = ['text']
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
text_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(text_features)

# Combine features
train = pd.concat([train, pd.DataFrame(text_features)], axis=1)
test = pd.concat([test, pd.DataFrame(text_features)], axis=1)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(train, train['author'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=300, max_depth=10, random_state=42)

# Train
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
val_pred = model.predict(X_val)
print(f'Validation Loss: {multiclassification_loss(model, y_val, labels=3)}')

# Save predictions
submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': test['id'], 'author': model.predict(X_test)})
submission.to_csv('submission/submission.csv', index=False)
