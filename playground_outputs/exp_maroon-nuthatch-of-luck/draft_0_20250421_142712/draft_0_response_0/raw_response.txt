Okay, so I need to solve this Kaggle competition problem where I have to predict the author of a sentence as one of three: Poe, Lovecraft, or Shelley. The task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the author of a given text. 

First, I should understand the problem thoroughly. The goal is to predict the author based on the text content. The data provided includes three columns: EAP, HPL, and MWS, which are float values representing different metrics. These metrics likely correspond to the author's style or characteristics. The task is to use this data to predict the author.

I need to plan the approach. Since the task is classification with three possible outcomes, I can use a classification model. Multi-class classification is suitable here. I should consider different models and evaluate their performance.

Looking at the data, I see that the input has three columns with float values. These might be indicators of the author's style. I should preprocess the data to extract features from these metrics. Maybe I can create new features or use the existing ones as they are.

Next, I need to choose a model. XGBoost is a good choice because it's efficient and can handle feature engineering well. It's also a good candidate for multi-class classification. I'll use scikit-learn's XGBoost classifier.

For evaluation, I should use multi-class logarithmic loss because it's suitable for multi-class classification and it penalizes the model based on the probability assigned to the true class. This will give a clear measure of how well the model is performing.

Now, the plan is to load the data, extract features from EAP, HPL, and MWS, and then train the model. I'll split the data into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance. After training, I'll make predictions on the test set and print the evaluation metric.

I need to structure the code. First, I'll import necessary libraries. Then, I'll load the data from the input directory. I'll extract the features and target variable. Split the data into training and validation sets. Train the model, then evaluate it using the validation set. Finally, make predictions on the test set and print the evaluation metric.

I should also ensure that the code is clean and well-structured. I'll use clear variable names and comments where necessary. The code should be self-contained and runnable without additional setup.

Potential issues to consider: handling the float values correctly, ensuring the data is properly split, and making sure the model is trained on the right features. Also, since the data is already prepared, I don't need to perform any feature engineering beyond what's given.

In summary, the plan is to use XGBoost for multi-class classification, extract the features from the float values, split the data, train the model, evaluate it, and make predictions. The evaluation metric will be the multi-class logarithmic loss.

# Code
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, log_loss
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('input/sample_submission.csv')

# Extract features and target
X = data[['EAP', 'HPL', 'MWS']]
y = data['author']

# Split into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize model
model = XGBClassifier()

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate on validation set
val_loss = log_loss(y_val, model.predict(X_val))
print(f"Validation Loss: {val_loss}")

# Make predictions on test set
test_data = pd.read_csv('input/test.csv')
y_pred = model.predict(test_data)
y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(test_data)

# Save predictions
submission_path = 'submission/submission.csv'
pd.DataFrame({'id': test_data['id'], 'predicted': y_pred}).to_csv(submission_path, index=False)

# Print evaluation metric
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
