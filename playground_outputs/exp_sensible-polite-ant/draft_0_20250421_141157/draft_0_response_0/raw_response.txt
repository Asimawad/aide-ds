Okay, so I need to solve this Kaggle competition problem where I have to predict the author of a sentence as one of three: Poe, Lovecraft, or Shelley. The task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the author of a given text. 

First, I should understand the problem thoroughly. The goal is to predict the author based on the text content. The data provided includes three columns: EAP, HPL, and MWS, which are numerical values representing different metrics. These metrics likely correspond to the author's style or characteristics. The task is to use this data to predict the author.

I need to plan the approach. Since the task is classification with three possible outcomes, I should consider using a classification model. Multi-class classification is suitable here because there are three distinct classes: Poe, Lovecraft, and Shelley. 

I should start by reading the data to understand the structure. The input has three CSV files: train, test, and sample_submission. The text is in the 'text' column, and the metrics are in 'EAP', 'HPL', and 'MWS'. The task is to predict the author, so I need to extract features from the text and use them to predict the author.

I should consider feature engineering. The text is a sequence of words, so maybe extracting features like word frequency, n-grams, or TF-IDF could help. TF-IDF might be useful because it can capture the importance of words based on their frequency across documents. Also, using n-grams could capture local patterns in the text.

Next, I need to decide on the model. Multi-class classification can be done with various algorithms. Since the data is text-based, models like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines might not perform well, but others like Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Trees could. However, since the data is text, perhaps a transformer-based model like BERT or RoBERTa would be better. But given the time constraints, maybe a simpler model like Multinomial Naive Bayes could be used for a quick start, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, a decision tree or Random Forest could be used.

Wait, but the metrics EAP, HPL, MWS are numerical. Maybe I can use them as features. However, they are on a continuous scale, and predicting the author based on these might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the metrics can be used to encode the author, but that seems complicated.

Another approach is to use the text features and combine them with the metrics. For example, using TF-IDF features and the metrics as features. But I'm not sure how to combine them effectively.

I should also consider data preprocessing. Text data often requires tokenization, stop-word removal, and maybe TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features. Also, handling imbalanced classes is important because the data might be imbalanced, and the authors might have varying numbers of samples.

For the model, I can try a few approaches:

1. Text-based models: TF-IDF features with a classifier.
2. Feature engineering with TF-IDF and metrics.
3. Using the metrics as features, but that might not capture the text's context well.

I think using TF-IDF features and combining them with the metrics could be a good approach. So, the plan is:

- Read the text and extract TF-IDF features.
- Use the metrics as additional features.
- Use a classifier to predict the author.

For the model, I can try a Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Tree since they can handle multi-class classification well.

Now, for the code. I'll need to:

1. Read the data: train, test, and sample_submission.
2. Preprocess the text: split into words, apply TF-IDF.
3. Combine the TF-IDF features with the metrics.
4. Split the data into training and validation sets.
5. Train the model.
6. Evaluate on the validation set and print the metrics.

I should also consider the evaluation metric. Since it's multi-class, log loss is appropriate. I can use scikit-learn's Log Loss or implement a custom function.

Wait, but the metrics EAP, HPL, MWS are numerical. How can I use them as features? Maybe they can be normalized or used as-is. Alternatively, perhaps the metrics can be used to encode the author, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the metrics can be used to predict the author, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the metrics can be used to create a feature that represents the author. For example, if EAP is high, it might be Poe, and so on. But that's a simplistic approach and might not work well.

Alternatively, perhaps the metrics can be used to create a feature vector that can be used by a classifier. For example, using EAP, HPL, MWS as features. But since they are numerical, perhaps a linear model could work, but non-linear models might perform better.
