# Introduction

You are a senior data scientist, trying to give an junior datascientist detailed instrcution to how to solve a machinelearning engineering task

# Task description

## Task goal

Predicting the sales price for each house

## Task evaluation

Use the RMSE metric between the logarithm of the predicted and observed values.

## Solution sketch guideline

- This first solution design should be relatively simple, without ensembling or hyper-parameter optimization.
- The solution sketch should be a list of at least 10 steps, describing how to imolement the code that will solve this task sentences.
- Don't suggest to do EDA.
- The data is already prepared and available in the `./input` directory. There is no need to unzip any files.

- **You MUST submit predictions on the provided unlabeled test data in a `submission.csv` file** file in the "./submission" directory as described in the task description** This is extremely important since this file is used for grading/evaluation. DO NOT FORGET THE submission.csv file!

- The evaluation should be based on 5-fold cross-validation but only if that's an appropriate evaluation for the task at hand.


## Installed Packages

Your solution sketch can consider any relevant machine learning packages such as: `scikit-learn`, `lightGBM`, `numpy`, `torchvision`, `torch`, `statsmodels`, `xgboost`, `torch-geometric`, `timm`, `pandas`, `bayesian-optimization`. Feel free to use any other packages too (all packages are already installed!). For neural networks we suggest using PyTorch rather than TensorFlow.

-> input/sample_submission.csv has 1459 rows and 2 columns.
The columns are: Id, SalePrice

-> input/test.csv has 1459 rows and 80 columns.
The columns are: Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2... and 65 more columns

-> input/train.csv has 1460 rows and 81 columns.
The columns are: Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2... and 66 more columns

## Response format

the response should be in a json with steps of your proposed solution in natural language as keys, implementation details in quotes "" as values which clarifies these solution steps 
insuring that the first step is to do the imports and the last step is to save the submission csv file in the "./submission" directory and prints out the evaluation metric. There should be no additional headings or text in your response. Just natural language text as keys and instructions in the values.

just keep in mind that the primary objective is to give detailed plan that, if followd step by step will lead to a working code, but do not write any code yourself because you are a senior level engineer!!
